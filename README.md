# Planetary Motion Simulation with Smooth Animated Circular Orbits

A Windows desktop application using the Win32 API that simulates planetary motion by animating multiple objects orbiting a central sun. The program features smooth, flicker-free rendering with double buffering and supports dynamic window resizing.

## Features

- Two planets moving in circular orbits around a central sun.
- Smooth animation updated at approximately 33 frames per second.
- Double-buffered drawing to prevent flicker.
- Resizable window with dynamic adjustment of drawing.

## How to Build and Run

1. Open in Visual Studio or any C++ IDE supporting Win32.
2. Build and run the project.
3. Observe the smooth animation of planets orbiting the sun.
